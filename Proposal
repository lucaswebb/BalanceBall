Balance Ball Proposal

Goal: Create a platform that balances a ball using data from a camera above the platform.

Materials:
2 servo motors
1 small camera
1 Arduino
1 plastic colored platform
Wood to hold the platform and camera

Timeline:

Weekend of the 13th: Research camera detection, perhaps start writing code that will be able to detect the ball.  Plan the
design of the struture holding the platform and camera and determine how much wood and nails we will need.
Week of the 15th: Build the platform (including the motors to move it) and mount it and the camera on the wooden structure.  Finish
up the ball detection code.
Weekend of the 20th: Make code to tilt the platform based on where the ball is.
Week of the 22nd: Make final adjustments and test.

If there is extra time, it would also be cool to make an extra feature where the user can determine where the ball should be balanced.
For example, they can click on the corner of the platform, and it will move the ball there and keep it there.
