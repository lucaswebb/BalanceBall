Camera Tracking:

We will use a small camera to track the location of a ball.
The program will output coordinates and we can do whatever we want with them.
One example would be to have a GUI that shows the ball.

Materials:
Camera
Ball
Some sort of stand for camera (Balsa Wood)

Timeline:
Weekend of the 13th: Research cameras, start writing code that will be able to detect the ball. Plan the camera stand.
Week of the 15th: Finish the code for tracking.
Weekend of the 20th: Build camera stand and mount camera and servos.
Week of the 22nd: Write code to move platform, make final adjustments, and test.
