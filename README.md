# BalanceBall

## About
This is a final project for Computer Science 490, Selected Topics, Physical Electronics, at Phillips Exeter Academy.  The project consists of a wooden platform connected to servos with a camera above it.  The camera tracks the location of a ball on the platform, and the servos balance it. The user can give the ball a push, and it will be balance back to the center.  The project was completed in a tight time frame, and as such, is not as polished as it could be.
