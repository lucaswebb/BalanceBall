# BalanceBall

## About
This is a final project for Computer Science 490, Selected Topics, Physical Electronics, class at Phillips Exeter Academy.  The project consists of a wooden platform connected to servos with a camera above it.  The camera tracks the location of a ball on the platform, and the servos balance it.  The projects was complete in a tight time frame and as such is not as polished as it could be.
